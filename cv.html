        <h2>Self Study</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In 2019 I started to develop more of an interest in software development,
          I decided to take a leap and began to take steps to understand what Software
          Development is all about and in 2020 finally took a Udemy course to add to my knowledge;
          I am currently studying back-end , as my goal is to be a full stack developer.</p>
